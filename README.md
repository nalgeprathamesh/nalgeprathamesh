# 👋 Hey there, I'm Prathamesh Nalge

> *"Turning imagination into real-world projects — one line of code at a time."*

## 🧠 About Me

I'm **Prathamesh Nalge**, a 17-year-old aspiring CS student from India with an *unshakable love for building things that matter*. Whether it's **automating tasks**, **crafting games**, or **learning how AI thinks**, I’m constantly evolving my skills through real-world projects and self-driven learning.

- 🎓 Preparing for **IPMAT, SAT**, and **engineering journey ahead**
- 💻 Learning Python, CS fundamentals, and AI through **CS50**, **CodeWithHarry**, and books
- 📺 I run a **YouTube channel** that still gets over **25k views/month**, even while I’m inactive
- 📚 Fan of books like *Atomic Habits* and *Sapiens*
- 🚴‍♂️ Love **cycling 10–20km daily** and exploring history & philosophy in my free time

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

I don't just learn concepts — I bring them to life with code:

- 🧪 **Python Projects:** Games, tools, and automation scripts
- 🤖 **AI Experiments:** Chatbots, voice assistants, and more
- 📊 **Learning Logs:** Markdown notes and summaries for others to learn from too
- 📦 Explore all of it in my [Projects Repository](https://github.com/prathameshnalge/projects)

## ✅ The Transparency Manifesto

> **Transparency matters more than pretending to be perfect.**

Every project folder includes a special file: `transparency.md`  
It clearly outlines how the code was created:

- ✅ **Code written entirely by me**
- ⚙️ **Code assisted or improved using AI** (like ChatGPT)
- 👨‍🏫 **Tutor-guided code** (e.g., from courses like CS50)
- 🧠 **Code copied or adapted** as part of learning modules

This honest system shows what’s **original**, what’s **assisted**, and what’s **studied** — no smoke, no mirrors.

Also included in this profile:
- 🔒 A **proof-of-ownership document** to protect authorship and intellectual rights
- 📜 A **custom LICENSE** allowing learning, remixing, and fair use — but restricting full file copying without permission

## 🚀 My Philosophy

> “Learn in public. Build in the open. Share with honesty.”

I believe in:
- 🧠 Learning by doing  
- 🔍 Sharing the *how*, not just the *what*  
- 🛠️ Building things that are useful, fun, or just plain cool  
- 🚀 Documenting my journey for future me (and maybe for you too)
